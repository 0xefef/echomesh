# This is an example of an Element that uses Events.
#
# It searches Twitter for one or more keys at regular intervals and sends out
# Events for each new Tweet.

type: repeat
period: 1 second     # Search once a second.

element:
  type: twitter
  search:
    - xyzzy              # Search for any Twitter containing the string xyzzy.
    - "#baseball"        # Search for the hashtag #baseball.
                         # You have to put #baseball in quotes so it doesn't
                         # become a comment!
                         # You could also just write this:
                         # search: [xyzzy, "#baseball"]

  handler:
    type: print          # Print the twitter to the console.

  # The handler section is optional.
  # Were there no handlers, Events would be passed up to the Score.
