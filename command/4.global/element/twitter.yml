# This is an example of an Element that uses Events.
#
# It searches Twitter for one or more keys at regular intervals and sends out
# Events for each new Tweet.

type: TwitterSearch

interval: 1 second     # Search once a second.

search:
  - xyzzy              # Search for any Twitter containing the string xyzzy.
  - "#baseball"        # Search for the hashtag #baseball.
                       # You have to put #baseball in quotes so it doesn't
                       # become a comment!

handler:
  type: print          # Print the twitter to the console.

# The handler section is optional.
# Were there no handlers, Events would be passed up to the Score.
